## Setup Instructions
You can follow these steps to get the Plant Tracker application up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Download from nodejs.org.
PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL. The interactive installer for Windows is recommended. Download from postgresql.org.
Git: For cloning the repository. Download from git-scm.com.

### 2. Database Setup
Install PostgreSQL: If you haven't already, install PostgreSQL using the interactive installer. Remember the password you set for the postgres user.
Open pgAdmin: Launch pgAdmin (usually installed with PostgreSQL).

**Create Database:**

Connect to your PostgreSQL server (using the postgres user and your password).
Right-click on "Databases" -> "Create" -> "Database...".
Name the new database plant_tracker and click "Save".

**Create Table:**

Expand your plant_tracker database, then "Schemas" -> "public" -> "Tables".
Right-click on "Tables" and select "Query Tool".
Paste the following SQL command into the query window and execute it (lightning bolt icon):

`CREATE TABLE plants (`  
    `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,`  
    `name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,`   
    `species VARCHAR(255),`  
    `image_url VARCHAR(255),`   
    `last_watered DATE,`  
    `purchase_date DATE`   
`);`  

### 3. Project Setup
**Clone the Repository:**

git clone <https://github.com/KTKCodes/Plant-Tracker>  
cd plant_tracker_project

**Navigate to Backend:**

cd backend

**Install Dependencies:**

npm install

**Configure Database Credentials:**

Open server.js in your backend folder.

Locate the Pool configuration and update the user and password fields with your PostgreSQL username (likely postgres) and the password you set during installation.

`const pool = new Pool({`  
    `user: 'postgres', // Your PostgreSQL username`  
    `host: 'localhost',`  
    `database: 'plant_tracker',`  
    `password: 'your_password', // Your PostgreSQL password`  
    `port: 5432,`  
`});`  

Move Static Assets: Ensure your styles.css is in backend/public/styles/ and your myplants.js (simplified for modal only) is in backend/public/scripts/. Also, ensure other static HTML pages (dashboard.html, settings.html, wishlist.html) are in backend/public/pages/.

***

## Running the Application
**Start the Server:**

From your terminal, ensure you are in the backend directory:

`cd plant_tracker_project/backend`  

**Run the server:**

`node server.js`  

You should see a message in the console: Server is running at http://localhost:3000.

**Access the Application:**

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

You should now see the Plant Tracker homepage, styled correctly. You can add new plants, and they will persist in your database and appear on the homepage!
